== Undrafted Core Concept ==

Define envelopes as an arbitrary data storage format that utilizes witness date. Specifically, parse witness data for a record with the shape [OP_0, OP_IF, PUSH_DATA "ProtoID Eg. 'ord'", OP_0, ..., OP_ENDIF].
This is sufficiently abstract enough to support many meta-protocols and flexible enough to encapsulate the Ordinal Project's Inscription data structure.
